# InnerWellness-An-ML-Model-for-depression-detection
Project Description:

This project aimed to develop and evaluate a depression model using a dataset consisting of the tweets of 20,000 Twitter users. The goal was to gain insights into users' emotional states and provide a predictive model for detecting signs of depression based on their tweets. The following key steps were undertaken in this project:

1.Data Collection:
The dataset used in this project consisted of the tweets of 20,000 Twitter users. These tweets served as the basis for training and testing the depression model.

2.Model Training:
Multiple classifiers, including Extra Tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree, were employed to train the depression model. Each classifier was evaluated to determine its effectiveness in detecting signs of depression.

3.Sentiment Analysis:
To gain insights into users' emotional states, sentiment analysis was conducted on the Twitter data. Textblob, a popular Python library for sentiment analysis, was utilized to determine the sentiment polarity of each tweet, which helped in understanding the emotional context of the users.

4.Feature Extraction:
Feature extraction is a crucial step in any machine learning model. In this project, TFidf (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization was employed for feature extraction. This technique effectively captured the important textual features within the tweets, enhancing the model's ability to make accurate predictions.

5.Model Evaluation:
The trained depression model was evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This evaluation process helped assess the model's performance and determine its effectiveness in detecting depression indicators.

6.Model Deployment:
The depression model can be deployed in various applications to identify potential signs of depression among Twitter users. This can contribute to early intervention and support for individuals who may be experiencing mental health challenges.




Usage:
To use this depression model, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.Ensure that Python and the required libraries (such as scikit-learn, nltk, and Textblob) are installed.

3.Run the provided scripts to preprocess the dataset, perform sentiment analysis, and train the depression model using the chosen classifier(s).

4.Once the model is trained, you can input new tweets or test data to predict the likelihood of depression.
